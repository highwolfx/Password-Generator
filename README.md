# Password Generator


## Description

This third homework assignment was designed to be a password generator that can be used for generating random passwords for different sites, similar to the ones found built into Chrome or on third party software, such as LastPass, Dashlane, or Keeper.

## Usage

Deployed webpage can be found [here](https://highwolfx.github.io/Password-Generator/). 

There is a [slider](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highwolfx/Password-Generator/main/assets/slider.jpg) to adjust the desired password length. The minimum amount of characters is 8, while the maximum allowed is 128.

Underneath the slider, there are 4 options that can be checked. These allow the corresponding types of characters to be used in the password. Uppercase characters include the 26 English uppercase characters, and the lowercase ones include the 26 lowercase characters. Numbers include 0-9 and the specials symbols include the 10 symbols found when holding "Shift + (number in the number row)". Multiple options can be selected when generating a password.

After pressing "Generate Password", a password will show up in the output box, which can then be copied and pasted into other fields.
